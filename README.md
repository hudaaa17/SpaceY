# ðŸš€ SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Success Prediction & Data Analysis

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project analyzes **SpaceX Falcon 9** and **Falcon Heavy** launch data to predict the success of the first-stage landing. Predicting landing outcomes is crucial because successful landings enable rocket reusability, significantly reducing launch costs. The project also provides insights into launch site performance, payload mass, booster versions, orbit types, and other mission-related parameters.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Collect and preprocess SpaceX launch data from the **SpaceX API** and **Wikipedia**.
- Clean, transform, and analyze launch data for trends in booster versions, payload mass, and launch outcomes.
- Explore relationships between launch parameters using visualizations such as scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, and maps.
- Build classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN) to predict first-stage landing success.
- Compare model performance using cross-validation and test set accuracy.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for visual exploration of launch statistics.
